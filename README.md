# Auto Arch
This is my personal Arch Linux installation script. This script will install the BSPWM tiling window manager and the Kitty terminal emulator.

# Instructions:
> **After booting the install medium**
- Partition the disk using the tool of your choice (fdisk, cfdisk, etc)
- Download the script: `curl -Lo aa tinyurl.com/auto-arch`
- Run the script: `bash aa`
- Answer the prompts
- Let the script install the operating system (you can walk away)
